= Introduction =

There will be three iterations for this project. Each iteration will produce a working prototype of our application, each building off of the previous iterations.


= Details =

*Iteration 1*

The first iteration will produce a working white board that manages user stories. The user will be able to move user stories and user story tasks around the white board. All of the user stories and their tasks will be persisted to the Google DataStore and our application will be deployed to the Google AppEngine.

*Iteration 2*

The second iteration will add a user story pile and a user story backlog to the application. The user will be able to add user stories onto the user story pile, sort those stories into a backlog, and drag the stories from the backlog onto the current white board. The white board at this point is only usable at a project wide level.

*Iteration 3*

This iteration will be the final deliverable. It will add the functionality for teams. Now, there will be the project wide white board that was delivered in iteration 2, as well as team specific white boards.
