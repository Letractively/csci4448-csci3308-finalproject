= Introduction =

There will be three iterations for this project. Each iteration will produce a working prototype of our application, each building off of the previous iterations.

=Platforms & Tools=


>Google Web Toolkit (GWT)

>Google app engine

>Google datastore

>Subclipse (SVN)

>Eclipse

>Google Project

= Iteration Plan =
*Iteration 1*

The first iteration will produce a working white board that manages user stories. The user will be able to move user stories and user story tasks around the white board. All of the user stories and their tasks will be persisted to the Google DataStore and our application will be deployed to the Google AppEngine.



*Iteration 2*

The second iteration will add a user story pile and a user story backlog to the application. The user will be able to add user stories onto the user story pile, and sort those stories into a backlog. The white board at this point is only usable at a project wide level.



*Iteration 3*


This iteration will be the final deliverable.  Now, there will be the project wide white board that was delivered in iteration 2, as well as drag the stories from the backlog onto the current white board.


*Options for further development*


Team specific white boards as well as the project wide white board.
It will add the functionality for teams.

=Group Schedule=

*Scrum meetings* 10 minutes before class 12:20-12:30 T&Th


*Ramp Up Time* Jacob will bring us up to speed on GWT â€“ scheduled time on our own

Kyle, Vitus, and Hameed would need adequate ramp up time.  From Jacob's experience it appears this will take a fair amount of time.  We expect this to take a majority of iteration 1, and possibly some of iteration 2.
